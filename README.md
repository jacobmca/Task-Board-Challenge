# Task-Board-Challenge

## Description

This is my repository for the UC Berkeley eDX Bootcamp's challenge for Week 5: Third Party APIs. I completed this challenge to demonstrate basic JQuery/JQuery UI concepts and Bootstrap styling.

This repository contains the code for a one-page task board, where users can generate a card-based to do list. The user can click the "Add Task" button on the top and input a title, due date, and description to generate a new card task for the to do list. The user can then drag the card between the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns.

Cards that are three days or less away from their due date are styled yellow. Cards that are overdue are styled red. All other cards are styled white, with cards in the "Done" column automatically styled to white.

This project utilizes JQuery and JQuery UI, and is styled primarily with Bootstrap.
